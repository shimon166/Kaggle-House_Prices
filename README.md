# Kaggle-House_Prices
The current project is part of student kaggle competition named House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.
Pre processing and combination of Lasso and NN models drove me and my partner to 24 position on the leader board with error of 0.11348 (10/08/2017).

List of tested models:
1. Lasso Regressor
2. XGBoost
3. SVR Regressor
4. MLP Regressor (NN of Sklearn)
